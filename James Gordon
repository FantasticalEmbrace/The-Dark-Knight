                <h1>James Gordon</h1>
            <p>
                Detective Gordon and his partner Bullock were sitting at the station writing a report on the latest 
                case they had closed. Bullock was eating as usual, and Gordon was typing while sipping freshly made 
                coffee. They were going back and forth as they frequently did, joking around: Bullock with his 
                obnoxious, brash humor, and Gordon with the casual smirk playing along dryly. The evening commanding 
                officer yelled to them that they were needed. Someone had been murdered in an alleyway by the Monarch 
                Theater. It was almost quitting time for them, so Bullock was a little bummed, but Gordon was ready 
                to go.

                Several officers had already shown up when they arrived at the scene. Gordon noticed a kid with a 
                traumatized look on his face that the EMTs were checking out. They walked into the crime scene and 
                uncovered the faces while asking for the identities of the victims. The forensic officer informed them 
                that it was Thomas and Martha Wayne. Harvey and James gasped in disbelief that Gotham's two most 
                prominent people were on the ground before them, now forever gone. Both the detectives had encounters 
                with the Waynes, and both were good interactions. They had done a lot for the city and were considered 
                significant assets by most of the populace and humble caretakers to the city of Gotham. This was a sad 
                day indeed for the troubled city.

                While Harvey questioned officers and witnesses, Gordon walked over to the boy to check on him and speak 
                positive words to bring at least a touch of light into the boy's now-darkened world. He also hoped to 
                maneuver a question or two into the conversation to try and get a description of the perpetrator. First, 
                he asked the EMT if he was injured, and after she said the boy wasn't, he opened up with the usual stupid 
                icebreaker a cop always asks the murder victim's family, "How are you, son?" The boy said nothing; he just 
                stared wide-eyed into the abyssal darkness. The EMT told him that he had not spoken to them either. Harvey 
                walked over and said, "So far, all we got is some of the witnesses reported seeing the perp run from the 
                alley and jump in a car with no tag. It sped off in that direction." Jim, as people who knew him best 
                always called him, decided that he and Harvey would carry the boy back to the station themselves and 
                attempt to talk to him on the way. They decided to go ahead and leave and hoped forensics could find 
                something more out.

                With the kid in the back seat, they drove back to the precinct slowly and steadily. Harvey first offered 
                him a donut, but they still got no response. Jim told the boy that they were going to do the best they 
                could to find the man who murdered his parents and that anything he could say to them would help in finding 
                him. Jim told him, "I'm very sorry for what has happened to your parents. They were good people." A brief 
                pause occurred, and then Jim asked, "So, what's your name?" No matter what they did to reach him, the boy 
                was in too great a shock.

                They arrived, took the young one inside, and gave him a chair in their shared office. Jim set a hot cup of 
                cocoa before the kid and put a warm blanket on his shoulders. Jim suddenly noticed a car pulling up outside, 
                and a middle-aged man came racing in through the front door. He interacted with Harvey, and Jim could see 
                Detective Bullock motioning for him to follow him. The man rushed into the office, beheld the boy 
                affectionately, and whispered, "Bruce."  The moment the boy noticed the man, Jim witnessed the first reaction 
                he saw the boy have that night: tears and a warm embrace.
