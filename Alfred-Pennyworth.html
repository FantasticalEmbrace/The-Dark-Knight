       <center><h2><p style="color: white;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium',">Sweat ran down his face from shock and fear while he raced to the police 
        headquarters as fast as the car would take him. Just moments ago, he received the phone call delivering the news of the death of 
        his friend and employer. With his heart pounding and his body full of adrenaline, he could only imagine what was going through the 
        boy's mind. The only thing that mattered at this point was getting to the child. Numerous questions exploded in his mind of what ifs 
        and what to dos. If only he had been there to protect them all. He would gladly take their place if only it were him instead. He would 
        make sure that his friend would be honored accordingly and that he would take care of the prodigy he and his wife have now left behind 
        and see his legacy respected.</p></h2>

        <h2><p style="color: white;font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium',"> The car suddenly stopped; he jumped out and ran inside the police station. The commissioner motioned to follow him as he hurriedly 
        ran toward Gotham's latest victim. And then, there he was, sitting, his eyes bulging and staring at the wall. Alfred stood and looked 
        for a second pondering what his following words would be. Then he whispered empathetically, Bruce. At that moment, the boy turned and 
        saw his friend and butler; tears rushed to his eyes and began to flow one after the other on either side. Then he ran into the arms of 
        familiarity, and they embraced an embrace that, for a moment and if only a second, seemed to tear away the despair they were both feeling. 
        Alfred knew that he would have to step up and do his best to wear the shoes now, unwillingly, handed down to him and be Bruce's guide in 
        business and in life. He would be the best servant and father he could be: he would do so with pride. </p></center></h2>
