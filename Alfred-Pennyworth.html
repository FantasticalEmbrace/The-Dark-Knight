                <p class="alfred-text"> Sweat ran down his face from shock and fear while he raced to the police headquarters as fast as the car 
                would take him. Just moments ago, he received the phone call delivering the news of the death of his friend and employer. With his 
                heart pounding and his body brimming with adrenaline, he could only imagine what was going through the boy's mind. The only thing 
                that mattered at this point was getting to the child. Numerous questions exploded in his mind of what ifs and what to dos. If only 
                he had been there to protect them all. He would gladly take their place if only it were him instead. He would make sure that his 
                friend would be honored accordingly and that he would take care of the prodigy he and his wife have now left behind and see his 
                legacy respected. </p>

                <p class="alfred-text"> The car suddenly stopped; he jumped out and ran inside the police station. He told a detective what he 
                was there for, and the officer motioned to follow him as he hurriedly ran toward Gotham's latest victim. And then, there he 
                was, sitting, his eyes bulging and staring at the wall. Alfred stood and looked for a second, pondering his following words. 
                Then he whispered empathetically, Bruce. At that moment, the boy turned and saw his friend and butler; tears rushed to his eyes 
                and began to flow one after the other on either side. Then he ran into the arms of familiarity, and they embraced an embrace 
                that, for a moment and if only a second, seemed to tear away the despair they were both feeling. Alfred knew that he would have 
                to step up and do his best to wear the shoes now, unwillingly, handed down to him and be Bruce's guide in business and in life. 
                He would be the best servant and father he could be; he would do so with pride. </p>
