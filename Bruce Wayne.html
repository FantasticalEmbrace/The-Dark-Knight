                <h1>Bruce Wayne</h1>                
                    <p>The echoing screams of the child could be heard far from the dark confines of the 
                    alleyway, equally as resounding and chilling as the two shots that rang out before. As the culprit 
                    ran off, he had no idea that the destruction he had caused in the boy's life would someday create 
                    his own undoing. Orphaned in an instant and now alone in the gruesome scene where just before, a 
                    rejoicing family was elatedly discussing their wonderful evening together as they made their way 
                    home, unbeknownst to them that this would be their last outing together. And now, every detail of 
                    this haunting scene would be forever ingrained into the young one's psyche.</p>
                    <p>Years would pass as the nightmares persisted, and every time he awoke thinking and hoping it was a false reality. 
                    But every day, as he ran down the halls looking for them, he only ever passed the faithful, loving butler 
                    as the walls reflected on nothing but the empty quiet of the mansion. Through his tragic loss, he found 
                    humility and patience. And patience was the greatest weapon in his struggle with his lust for revenge. As 
                    the years ticked by, he trained his body and mind to prepare for the assured conflict ahead. The battle that 
                    he would not only have with his parents' murderer but for all the would-be victims of the dark streets of Gotham. 
                    He would dedicate his life to protecting the innocent. And one day, Bruce Wayne would have his vengeance. </p>
