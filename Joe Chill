            <h1>Joe Chill</h1>
            <p class="p1">
                Joe had unexpectedly received the message that Lew Moxon wanted to meet with him. He had 
                wondered why someone of so much importance would request the assistance of a lowly street 
                thug like himself. He had grown up poor without the guidance of a father. His mother told 
                him that his dad was the one that she thought she would marry. His mother, Sandra Chilton, 
                thought cocaine was adult candy and would often use it in the company of the many "loves 
                of her life" and in Joe's presence when he was a child. His father had not even been 
                interested in signing his birth certificate, and there was no trace of him in Gotham. 
                However, Joe did not bother himself with petty things of the past. Although he had daddy 
                issues when he was growing up, Joe was living in "the now," and "now" he had graduated 
                from petty carjackings and shoplifting to being called on to work for one of the big timers. 
                Joe could not fathom how Lew found him, knew his name, or why the mob boss would choose him, 
                and Joe didn't care. He was just glad that he was finally stepping up in the world.
            </p>            
            <p class="p2">
                As he walked into the room, Joe felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. There were guards 
                outside and inside Lew's office. All of them were of various sizes and armed with different 
                types of guns. Joe's hardened features were shadowed by his fedora in the dimly lit room. 
                Donning a tattered sweater under a stained, tan trenchcoat and a pair of worn jeans, he made 
                his way to the mob boss' desk. The room was silent as Joe and the mob boss glared at each other. 
                Soon, a dance of power and persuasion would commence, and Lew's heavy influence and threatening 
                presence would have the upper hand. Lew proposed a hit and offered two hundred and fifty thousand 
                dollars if Joe would take out two people. Two critical people in Gotham. "I chose you because I 
                want this to look like a simple robbery. Shoot 'em and take something off of 'em while you do it,
                " said Lew in that thick Italian-American accent that has become commonplace in the metropolises 
                of New York. Joe responded almost nervously, "I can't take a chance of double murder on two fifty. 
                Make it one million, and we gotta deal." The mob boss returned nonchalantly, "Five hundred thousand,
                 or I'll just find another guy, and you get silenced about the whole plan." Joe agreed to the 
                 arrangement and walked out of the office, trying his best to conceal his excitement. 
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                Later that evening, while he was sitting in the abandoned gas station he slept in frequently, Joe was 
                viewing the contents of the package given to him by Lew, which contained a Colt M1911A1 and photos of 
                the couple and their young son as he was downing a fifth of cheap vodka. On the back of one of the images 
                was written, "Thomas and Martha Wayne," he immediately gasped, at once realizing what was at stake if he
                was caught. Joe second-guessed the hit because these were not only important people in Gotham, they were 
                the most essential people in Gotham. As Joe was warming himself with the fire he had kindled on the bare 
                concrete floor and was cooking some canned beans in a pot, he thought about his situation and realized it 
                couldn't get much worse. If he got caught, then at least there would be a warm bed to sleep in with three 
                meals daily. If he didn't get caught, he could live the rest of his life with at least a home and work that 
                would pay well. His name would become renowned throughout the criminal underworld, and he would become rich 
                doing more hits. "Yeah, a mob hitman," he thought as he smiled gleefully at the thought and how cool it 
                sounded. He would never get the chance to get any honest work. No one would hire a man with a background 
                like his. No one would even consider interviewing someone who earned his living by means of petty theft. 
                Why, even the criminal big-timers usually didn't give him a chance. This was the most significant break he 
                would ever get, and it was worth the possibility of going to prison to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">
                Joe had been getting intel from some of Lew's men regarding the activity of the Waynes. He would go to public 
                events and watch them from a distance at shopping centers and restaurants, but they were always surrounded by 
                eyes. One night on the eve of a cold December night, one of Lew's men picked Joe up and told him they were going 
                to the opera house. The henchmen dropped Joe off near the alleyway. He would hang out there, and they would park 
                across the street and signal to him if they saw the Waynes alone so that he could make the hit. He sat in the cold 
                alleyway, wet from previous snowfall, for what seemed to be an eternity. He was curled up by a dumpster between a 
                side door to the opera house and the street it faced. Suddenly, the loud creak of that exact door echoed through 
                the alleyway. He looked towards it from the shadow of the dumpster he sat beside, and there they were. The Waynes 
                were coming out all alone. 
            </p>
           
            <p class="p5">
                The moment he had been waiting for was here, yet he hesitated. A sudden chilling fear ran from his head down his spine, 
                and a shake was in his hands. He had only robbed but never taken life. Realization set in, and he felt ridiculous and knew 
                that if he didn't get it together, he would be the one with a bullet in his chest. He gathered up the courage and picked
                himself up. Joe stood up and stepped out of the shadows, and the family became aware of his presence. Their laughter and 
                cheerful gait transformed into a slow falter accompanied by puzzled looks. Joe raised his gun, pointed it at Thomas Wayne, 
                and demanded his wallet. Thomas gathered his family behind him and lunged at Joe; a shot rang out. 
            </p>
            <p class="p6">
                Then, screams, and Thomas was on the ground, bleeding. Martha, attempting to disarm Joe, charged him. Her attempt failed, 
                and Joe pointed the gun at her face from underneath the pearl necklace wrapped around her neck. She froze in horror. He 
                slowly lowered the weapon to Martha's chest, and what sounded like thunder was heard throughout the alleyway. The child 
                seemed to be in a state of shock. His face beheld a cold, lifeless stare, fixated on nothing but looking toward Joe. Joe 
                thought to himself that it was enough. He was not paid to kill the boy. Besides that, even Joe couldn't stoop to that 
                level, and what would a kid do anyway. Joe searched through Thomas' coat, grabbed his wallet, and ran to the mobster's 
                car as fast as possible. He jumped in, and they sped off into the night towards Lew's stronghold.
