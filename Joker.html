            Batman crept in the cover of the night after the police were all gone. 
            Scouring through the barbarous scene before him, he sought any clues that 
            would lead him to the assailant. His first and most mysterious clue was the 
            playing cards scattered about the room. It was apparent that he was not dealing 
            with the same class of criminal that would rob banks or innocents walking in 
            alleyways for the sake of greed. No, this was a different creature that found 
            humor in chaos. This fact was made evident by the grins drawn on the lifeless 
            faces distributed throughout and that the playing cards left behind were the 
            same type: the Joker.
