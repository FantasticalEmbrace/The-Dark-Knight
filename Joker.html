                    Batman crept in the cover of the night after the police were all gone. Scouring through 
                    the barbarous scene before him, he sought any clues that would lead him to the assailant.
                     A blood-splattered banner with the words "Happy Retirement" hanging from the ceiling
                     and broken champagne glasses all about revealed that the evening had begun with a joyous 
                     occasion. With only the beam of the flashlight he was using to examine the crime scene, 
                     he could see the soulless eyes of the unfortunate staring back at him from the pale husks 
                     that were once filled with life. Now that life was everywhere: above and below him, and 
                     the walls all around. Their eyes were now frozen with permanent fright, and he knew right 
                     away from the gruesome sight all around that they had gone through a hell that even the 
                     best writers of horror could not even conjure up. But a more mysterious clue was the 
                     playing cards scattered about the room.

                    It suddenly became apparent that he was not dealing with the same class of criminal
                    that would rob banks or innocents walking in alleyways for the sake of greed. This 
                    creature found humor in chaos, pleasure in malice, and fulfillment in the fear of 
                    others. This was a monster of a different breed, much worse than those that haunted 
                    our childhood nightmares. This fact was made evident by the grins drawn on the lifeless 
                    faces distributed throughout and that the playing cards left behind were all the same: the Joker.
